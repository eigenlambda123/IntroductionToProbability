# Probability with Python
## Description
This repository contains Python implementations of examples and exercises from *Introduction to Probability* by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang. The goal is to translate R code from the book into Python, using libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. This repository serves as a resource for learning probability concepts and Python simultaneously.

## Contents
- Python equivalents of R code examples from the book.
- Implementations of key probability concepts (e.g., random variables, distributions, simulations).
- Visualization of probability distributions and outcomes.
- Solutions to selected exercises (where possible).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Version 3.10+
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas

## Goals
- Learn and reinforce probability concepts through coding.
- Practice translating statistical R code into Python.
- Build a reusable resource for probability enthusiasts.

## Important!!!
- This repo is Inspired by this: 'https://github.com/buruzaemon/IntroductionToProbabilityPy.git' and was only made for my own understanding about the book.
