# 📊 Probability with Python

## 📘 Description
This repository contains Python implementations of examples and exercises from *Introduction to Probability* by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang. The goal is to translate R code from the book into Python, using libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. This repository serves as a resource for learning probability concepts and Python simultaneously.

## 📂 Contents
- 🐍 Python equivalents of R code examples from the book.
- 🎲 Implementations of key probability concepts (e.g., random variables, distributions, simulations).
- 📈 Visualization of probability distributions and outcomes.
- 📝 Solutions to selected exercises (where possible).

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Version 3.10+
- **Libraries**: 
  - 🐍 NumPy
  - 🔬 SciPy
  - 📊 Matplotlib
  - 🗂️ Pandas

## 🎯 Goals
- 📚 Learn and reinforce probability concepts through coding.
- 🛠️ Practice translating statistical R code into Python.
- 🌟 Build a reusable resource for probability enthusiasts.
